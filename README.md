# ROS-Installation-steps-for-PC-and-JetsonNano
This repository contains steps for installing ROS. There are plenty of other methods for installing ROS and plenty of versions to go with it. However, These steps are based on my personal experience, so I will only cover the method that worked for me. The following installation steps were done on a computer running Windows 10. <br />

# FOR PC: 

1 - Install Oracle Virtual Box -  https://www.virtualbox.org/ <br />
2 - After installation is complete and set up, create a new virtual machine and make sure the *type* is __Linux__ and the version is __Ubuntu__ (64-bit or 32-bit depends on your hardware). <br />

3 - Follow the on-screen prompts and resize the partition and ram usage to your liking.

4 - Install Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa) - https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/
